In this project I used the algo "Turcsort" to sort the stack a. It picks the cheapest number in terms of operations and moves them to stacks b until there are only 3 numbers in stack a. Then it will the 3 numbers from stack a and move the numbers from stack b to a. Eventually it will move the min of stack a to the top of stack a.
The algo has a runtime of o(n^2)...
